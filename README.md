# binary-search-tree-operations-in-java
Binary Search Tree implementation and 9 different operations on BST in Java.

In this application, Binary Search Tree is implemented and 9 different operations are implemented on BST based on commands given.

### CreateBST n1, n2, ...
The binary search tree is created with the values n1, n2, n3, etc.

### CreateBSTH H
The perfect BST which has the height of 'H' is created with this input.  

### FindHeight
The height of the BST is found with this input.

### FindWidth
The width of the level of the BST which has the maximum number of nodes is found with this input.

### Preorder
The preorder traversal of the BST is written.

### LeavesAsc
All of the leave nodes of the BST are written.

### DelRoot
The root of the BST is deleted if it exits.

### DelRootLc
The left child of the root of the BST is deleted if it exists.

### DelRootRc
The right child of the root of the BST is deleted if it exists.


## Motivation
This application is developed to understand and grasp the idea behind the tree data structure and helped me to improve my algorithmic approach 
through different operations on the tree data structure.
